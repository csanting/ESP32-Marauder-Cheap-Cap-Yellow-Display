This is a fork of [Fr4nkFletcher's efforts that port the ESP32-Marauder firmware to the Cheap Yellow Display (CYD)](https://github.com/Fr4nkFletcher/ESP32-Marauder-Cheap-Yellow-Display). It is intended to document my efforts in adapting the firmware to the Cheap Cap Yellow Display (CCYD), a variation of the CYD that offers a capacitive touchscreen. The ESP32-Marauder firmware itself offers powerful WiFi and Bluetooth testing features on an affordable and accessible hardware platform.

## Setup & Programming

## Compatibility

## Example Usage

After flashing, your CYD module will boot into the Marauder interface. Refer to the [ESP32 Marauder Wiki](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/wiki) for detailed usage instructions.
